## Core Functions

### User Operations

```clarity
;; Deposit STX into a vault
(contract-call? .stacksyield deposit u1 u1000000) ;; Vault 1, 1 STX

;; Withdraw shares from vault
(contract-call? .stacksyield withdraw u1 u500000) ;; Vault 1, 0.5 shares

;; Manually trigger yield harvest
(contract-call? .stacksyield harvest-vault u1)
```

### Vault Management (Admin)

```clarity
;; Create new yield vault
(contract-call? .stacksyield create-vault
    "Conservative STX Vault"
    u1          ;; Risk level: 1=conservative
    u1000000)   ;; Minimum 1 STX deposit

;; Rebalance vault to better strategy
(contract-call? .stacksyield rebalance-vault u1 u3) ;; Switch to strategy 3
```

### Strategy Management (Admin)

```clarity
;; Add new yield strategy
(contract-call? .stacksyield add-strategy
    "New DeFi Protocol"
    "protocol-name"
    u2000       ;; 20% APY
    u50000000   ;; 50 STX capacity
    u6          ;; Risk score 6/10
    'SP123...)  ;; Protocol contract address

;; Update strategy APY
(contract-call? .stacksyield update-strategy-apy u1 u1300) ;; Update to 13%
```

## Vault Risk Levels

### Conservative (Level 1)

- **Focus**: Capital preservation with steady returns
- **Strategies**: Low-risk lending protocols
- **Target APY**: 5-10%
- **Risk Score**: 1-3

### Balanced (Level 2)

- **Focus**: Balanced risk/reward optimization
- **Strategies**: Mix of staking and lending
- **Target APY**: 8-15%
- **Risk Score**: 4-6

### Aggressive (Level 3)

- **Focus**: Maximum yield generation
- **Strategies**: High-yield LP farming, experimental protocols
- **Target APY**: 12-25%+
- **Risk Score**: 7-10

## Fee Structure

- **Platform Fee**: 0.5% on withdrawals (adjustable by admin)
- **Performance Fee**: 10% on generated yields (configurable)
- **Gas Optimization**: Batched operations to minimize transaction costs

## Technical Architecture

### Share-Based Accounting

```
Shares = (Deposit Amount √ó Total Shares) √∑ Total Assets
Assets = (User Shares √ó Total Assets) √∑ Total Shares
```

### Yield Calculation

- Real-time APY tracking per strategy
- Block-based yield accrual calculation
- Automatic compounding on deposits/withdrawals

### Strategy Selection Algorithm

- Risk-based strategy filtering
- APY optimization within risk tolerance
- Capacity-aware allocation decisions

## Default Strategies

| Strategy         | Protocol | APY | Risk | Capacity |
| ---------------- | -------- | --- | ---- | -------- |
| STX Staking      | Native   | 12% | 3/10 | 100K STX |
| Arkadiko Lending | Arkadiko | 8%  | 5/10 | 50K STX  |
| ALEX LP Farming  | ALEX     | 15% | 7/10 | 25K STX  |

## Read-Only Functions
